 * According to the oriented graph which is presented below. Create a program that would model the activities as they are represented. The
 events/activites are marked by an orage rectangular while the arrows show us the dependecies between them. 1 -> 2 means that the activity 1
 is dependent on the acitivity 2. In other words the activity 2 can not take place until the activity 1 is done.
